How To Run The Code:

in the zip we submitted we included main.c, server.c, Makefile (and the readme.txt). moreover, we added an exe files: main (for main.c), and server (for server.c)
if you want you can compile using the makefile we created.
if you want to compile everything at once write "make all"
if you want to only compile main.c write "make main".
if you want to only compile server.c write "make server".
in order to run main write "./main".
in order to run server write "./server".
in order to clean write "make clean".
enjoy.
